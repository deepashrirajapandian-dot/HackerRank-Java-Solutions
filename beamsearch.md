AIML LOCAL SEARCH ALGORITHM
Beam Search Algorithm – 20 Mark Answer
1. Introduction

In Artificial Intelligence, many problems such as path finding, game playing, and natural language processing require searching through large state spaces. Traditional algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) either consume too much memory or may not guarantee efficiency.

Beam Search is a heuristic search algorithm that improves efficiency by limiting the number of nodes explored at each level. It balances between completeness and memory usage.

                     2. Heuristic Search Techniques


A heuristic is a function that estimates how close a state is to the goal.

Represented as h(n)

Guides the search toward promising nodes

Reduces unnecessary exploration

Heuristics are useful in solving:

Traveling Salesman Problem

Pathfinding

Machine Translation

                                                    3. Definition of Beam Search


Beam Search is a heuristic-based search algorithm that:

Expands all nodes at the current level (like BFS)

Selects only the best W nodes (beam width)

Discards the remaining nodes

Continues until the goal is found

It is called “beam” because it restricts the search to a fixed-width beam.

                                                4. Important Terms

1. Beam Width (W)

Number of nodes retained at each level

Controls memory usage

Smaller W → Faster but may miss optimal solution

Larger W → Better solution but more memory

2. Branching Factor (B)

Number of successors generated by each node

At each level, algorithm evaluates W × B nodes

But selects only W nodes

                                     5. Working of Beam Search


Step-by-step process:

Initialization

Start from root node.

Expansion

Generate all successors of current nodes.

Evaluation

Apply heuristic function to calculate h(n).

Selection

Choose top W nodes with best heuristic values.

Iteration

Repeat expansion and selection.

Termination

Stop when goal is reached or no nodes left.

6. Algorithm (General Form)
Beam_Search(start, goal, W):

1. OPEN = {start}
2. While OPEN is not empty:
3.     Generate successors of all nodes in OPEN
4.     Evaluate each successor using heuristic
5.     Select top W best nodes
6.     Replace OPEN with selected nodes
7.     If goal found → return Success
8. Return Failure

7. LEARN_ONE_RULE Algorithm (General-to-Specific Beam Search)

Beam Search is used in Machine Learning for rule learning.

Steps:

Initialize most general hypothesis (θ)

Generate specializations by adding constraints

Evaluate performance

Select top k hypotheses

Repeat until best rule found

Final rule form:

IF Best_hypothesis THEN Prediction

8. Advantages of Beam Search

Memory Efficient

Only W nodes stored

Faster than BFS

Does not explore entire tree

Scalable

Suitable for large search spaces

Flexible

Beam width can be adjusted

9. Limitations

Not Complete

May miss goal if pruned

Not Always Optimal

Depends on beam width

Heuristic Dependent

Poor heuristic → poor solution

10. Applications of Beam Search

Natural Language Processing

Machine Translation

Speech Recognition

Text Generation

Robotics

Path planning

Game AI

Move selection

Machine Learning

Rule learning

11. Comparison with Other Algorithms
Feature	BFS	A*	Beam Search
Uses Heuristic	No	Yes	Yes
Memory Usage	High	High	Limited
Optimal	Yes	Yes	Not guaranteed
Speed	Slow	Moderate	Fast
12. Conclusion

Beam Search is a powerful heuristic search technique that balances between exhaustive search and greedy search. By limiting the number of nodes explored using beam width, it reduces memory usage and improves efficiency.

However, it does not guarantee optimal solutions and depends heavily on the heuristic function. It is widely used in NLP, robotics, game AI, and machine learning for solving large-scale search problems efficiently.
